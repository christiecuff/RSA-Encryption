# Intro to Git and GitHub assignment
1. You'll need your GitHub account to be created and verified before you can do this assignment.

 **IMPORTANT**: Do not contine this to the next step until there is a public.pen in the list of files. The code will not work without this file, and Mr. Simonsen adds the file when he is ready for students to do this assignment.
 
3. ```fork``` this repo
4. ```clone``` your fork to your machine via ```git clone <github-repository-address>``` in the terminal or using VSCode's built-in tools.
5. Create a new branch called 'assignment' using either VSCode's terminal with the command ```git chekout -b assignment``` or with VSCode's build in tools.
6. Run 'student.py' via VSCode's built in tools or in the terminal with ```python3 student.py```. Answer the prompts which will create a '.dat' file.
7. ```add``` and ```commit``` the file using VSCode's build-in tools or via the terminal with ```git add . && git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"```
8. ```push``` your code to GitHub via the built-in tools or terminal with ```git push```
9. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
